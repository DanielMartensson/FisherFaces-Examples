# Fisher faces examples

This library is Bytefish's Fisher faces library for image classification. I downloaded it and played around a little bit to learn how to use it. It's pure MATLAB/Octave code only. 

I decide to make a conclusion what would work with Fisher faces. Normally, today deep neural networks with convolutional neural networks(CNN) are often used. But they have their pros and cons. The prons with deep neural network is that they can handle large and complex different amout of data. The cons is that training a deep neural network requires time and patience. Deep neural network is nothing you train over a half an hour and expecting it would fit all the nonlinearities.

So I picked up servral image databases that are avaiable for free, but under some few circumstances. The can not be used for commersial use, only research use. So here is my research about the result from Fisher faces method.

# Databases
I have selected

- FEI Face Database
- IMPA-FACE3D Database
- JAFFED Database
- Yale Database

And then I have train a Fisher faces model and check its validation.

The FEI Face database constains two types of classes. People who smiles and people who don't smile.
